										<h2>Project Background</h2>
										<p>For one of our 4th year projects, we were tasked with selecting a power tool 
											provided to us by the university and investigating it through research and physically
											deconstrucing it. Examples of appliances that could have been selected include; a dehumidifier,
											a hedge trimmer, an electric screwdriver. However, I obviously wanted the challenge and picked
											a <a href="https://www.screwfix.com/p/titan-ttl758chn-a-2000w-230-240v-electric-40cm-chainsaw/338py">TITAN 2000W electric chainsaw</a>. 
											This project was split over 4 different submissions, each being a poster betweek 1-2 
											pages long.</p>
									</header>
									<div class="testsided-container left">
										<div class="content">
											<h2>Poster 1 - User Experience</h2>
											<p>The first exploration was into the user experience related to the product. This meant questioning
												why the designer chose to make the product the way they did. This included but not limited to; the weight of the product, 
												the style of the packaging, the ease of use and the safety features. It also meant doing some market research into the
												competitors of the product and how they compared. Finally suggesting any improvements that could be made to the product.

										</div>
										<div class="content">
											<h2>Poster 2 - Component Role and Function</h2>
											<p>The second poster of the project began the deconstrucing of the product. Finding out the different components and
												how they interacted with each other. This included the motor, the lubrication system, the switch, the safety stop and the emergency stop.
												A flow chart was created to demostrate how each system works together to make the product function and improvements were
												suggested to make the product more efficient and safe.	
											</p>

									</div>
									<div class="testsided-container left">
										<div class="content">
											<h2>Poster 3 - Manufacturing, Materials and Costs</h2>
											<p>The third set of the project was a complete deconstruction of the product. Identifying the material, weight and estimated 
												cost of each part to create a bill of materials. This was then used to estimate the manufacturing cost of the product and 
												what profit margin they are working with. The deconstruction also allowed me to Identify how the mass was distributed in the product
												 from assembly to assembly. Also as part of this poster, I explored the manufacting process to make one of the components of the chainsaw.
												 For this I selected the moulded case of the chainsaw. I did a deep dive into how the case was made, why it was made a certain why and 
												 what improvements could be made to the process. Other general improvements to specific parts on the chainsaw were also suggested.

											<h2>Poster 4 - Sustainability</h2>
											<p>For the final poster of the project, I explored the Sustainability of the product. This included the life cycle of the chainsaw, its 
												enviromental impact of use, and its current sustainable design choices such as ease of repair. Improvements were suggested to make the product
												more sustainable such as using more sustainable materials, Using a brushless motor and including a renuable source of power.
