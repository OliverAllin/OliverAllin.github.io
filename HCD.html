										<h2>Human Centered Design</h2>
										<p>Project Background</p>
									</header>
									
									<p>Once returning from placement, I began my 4th year specialising in Integrated Design Engineering. As part of
										this course, we explored the concept of human centered design (HCD). HCD is a design approach that revolves 
										around including the target user through-out the design process. For this project we were placed in groups of 4
										and worked with an individual who used the <a href="https://www.allcyclebathandwest.com/" >All Cycle Bath & West</a> 
										facilities. All Cycle Bath & West are 'a local and accessible cycling charity, promoting inclusive cycling for all 
										ages and abilities'. We were given very little information about the person we were going to meet from the charity,
										and what their disability is / or any difficulties they have cycling. The goal of our project was to design a product
										that would aid our individual and others and make cycling more accessible. </p>

											<h2>First Interactions</h2>
											<p> Our first interaction with our individual was an interview at the All Cycle Bath & West facilities. 
												We were introduced to our individual, and allowed to ask questions about their cycling experience and 
												partake in cycling along side them ourselves. This was a great opportunity to practice asking open questions
												and to understand the difficulties our individual faces. Some difficulties may not be noticeable at first, 
												so it was important to ask questions about their experience and how they felt about cycling. Our individual had a 
												neurodegenerative disability which meant that their dexterity was reduced and their were constricted to a wheelchair.
												This however didnt stop them from enjoying cycling as they had a hand powered bicycle they brought with them.  </p>

											<h2>Design Development</h2>
											<p> After our initial meeting, we began to brainstorm ideas for products that could aid our individual. From our interview,
												we learnt that our individual and many other users with dexterity issues, struggle to put on helmets. This is due to the
												fact that helmets are designed to be tight fitting and secure, which is great for safety, but not so great for accessibility.
												The Buckles used on helmets are often small and fiddly, and the straps are difficult to adjust. We ustilise a clock spring
												mechanism to create a helmet that is easy to put on and take off, and is adjustable to fit a range of head sizes. </p>

									</div>
									<div class="testsided-container left">
										<div class="content">
											<h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
											<p> Using this idea we proceeded to create a rapid prototype of the helmet using cardboard. This allowed us to bring the idea
												to our next user meeting to get initial feedback. The feedback was positive, and we were able to address any concerns about
												the design. The main one being the saftey aspect of the helmet, to counteract this, we designed an aditional locking mechanism to ensure
												that the helmet would not come off during use. We then 3D printed a prototype of the mechanism and attached it to a pre-existing helmet.
												We brought this design back to the user to ensure we work around their needs, adjusting anything that was needed. As this project was time 
												limited, we did some research into the next steps that would be needed to take in order finalise the design. Including but not limited to;
												The saftey standards that the helment would have to pass before sale, The saftey tests to ensure the locking mechanism wont fail, and the 
												comfortability/ease of use of the final design.

									<p>Finally we created our presentation poster and prepared for our final presentation/Viva Voche. During the presentation
										we were given 10 minutes to present out product to a team of experts (University Lecturers, Industry Professionals, and 
										the cycling Charity) followed by a 5 minute Q&A session. Finally, we individually had a 10 minute Viva Voche with the 
										course lecturer, where we were asked questions about the project and our individual contributions as well as general questions
										about out understanding of Human Centered Design.
